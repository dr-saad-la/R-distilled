    "## The Launcher\n",
    "\n",
    "- The initial interface you encounter is called the \"JupyterLab Launcher.\" This launcher serves as a hub where you can access and manage various tools and resources for your data science and programming tasks. Here's a breakdown of what you'll typically find on the JupyterLab Dashboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebook Section: At the top of the launcher, you'll see the \"Notebook\" section. This is where you can create, open, and manage your Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The big icons in the JupyterLab Launcher that allow you to start new activities, such as creating a new notebook or console, are often referred to as \"Launcher Cards\" or simply \"Cards.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "- These cards provide a visually appealing and easily accessible way to initiate different types of activities within JupyterLab. Each card typically represents a specific action or tool that you can launch with a single click.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can create a new jupyter notebook by pressing on this card. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Console Section:\n",
    "    - Just below the notebook section, you'll find the \"Console\" section. This area is where you can interact with programming languages directly through a console interface. For example, you can open Python or R consoles here to execute code and see immediate results without creating a full notebook. This is useful for quick experimentation and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other Tools and Terminals:\n",
    "    - This area includes terminals, where you can run command-line commands directly from within JupyterLab. There is also text editor and markdown editor. "

    "\n",
    "    - Widgets: If you're using interactive widgets, this menu provides options to manage and interact with them.\n",
